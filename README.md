*Sign Factory*
=============
Description
-----------
Given an inventory of current signs, and a list of required signs and where they will be mounted (post, and side of post) this will generate a list of which signs are extra, will be reused, and need to be created.  It also has a template scad file to create the signs.

Future version will allow the inventory and sign requirements to be provided via a csv file exported from any spreadsheet program, and the ability to provide a custom scad file.
